# React Shop Portfolio Project

[Demo](https://Yulya163.github.io/shop-project)

The project used:
- [FortniteApi.io](https://fortniteapi.io) - this API provides the most important data about Fortnite so you can use it in your apps, bots and web pages.
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com) - a modern responsive front-end framework based on Material Design.
